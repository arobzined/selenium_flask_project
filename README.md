# selenium_flask_project

This project is basically a educator of selenium and flask and how we can use them easily.I didn't spend so much time to design the html page , so you dont have to
try to understand inside the html code :D

# Running

You need to install Flask and Selenium to run this code. Just run app.py in your local server , open the localhost in your browsser (I use Chrome in here) and
enjoy :).

I used Akak√ße.com for getting the information about devices.
