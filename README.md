# selenium_flask_project

This project is basically a guide how you can use flask and selenium and how to make web scraping (THIS IS A !! VERY VERY !! SIMPLE EXAMPLE) using them.

# How to Run

Download the codes to your memory , download the modules in requirements.txt , run app.py and open your localhost 
in your browser (I used Chrome browser with selenium.)

I used Akak√ße.com to get the attributes about the devices.

Thanks for reading!
